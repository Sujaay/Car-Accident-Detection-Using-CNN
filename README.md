Certainly! Here's a basic README template for your Accident Detection System project:

Accident Detection System
Overview
The Accident Detection System is a computer vision-based project designed to detect accidents in real-time using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system processes video frames, predicts accidents, and triggers immediate notifications for timely response.

Features
Real-time Accident Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN to analyze video frames and detect accidents.
Notification System: Sends SMS notifications using the Twilio API when accidents are detected.
Audio Alerts: Provides immediate attention through audio alerts using the winsound library.
Probabilistic Display: Displays real-time accident status and probability on the video feed.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow, Keras
OpenCV
Twilio API for SMS notifications
NumPy
Winsound for audio alerts
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accident-detection-system.git
cd accident-detection-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure the following are available:

Video file (car2.mp4) or adjust code for camera input.
Twilio account credentials (account_sid and auth_token).
Model architecture (model.json) and weights (model_weights.h5).
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python accident_detection_script.py
Usage
Run the script with the specified setup.
Press 'q' to exit the video feed.
